    "There are nearly 1 million motor vehicles [[1]](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/annual-motor-vehicle-population-by-vehicle-type?view_id=6aca1157-ea79-4e39-9e58-3e5313a9a715&resource_id=dec53407-9f97-47b8-ba89-b2070569a09e) on Singapore's road network of more than 9,500 lane-kilometers which constitutes around 12% of the total Singapore Land Area [[2]](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/who_we_are/our_work/road.html#:~:text=Singapore's%20road%20network%20connects%20all,km%20of%20roads%20and%20expressways). Despite the high proportion of land being used for roads, Singapore still ranks 88th out of 405 cities in the World with the highest traffic congestion in peak hours [[3]](https://www.tomtom.com/traffic-index/ranking/). This puts Singapore a couple of spots above Sydney (rank 97) and not too far below Bangkok (rank 74). Singapore roads have an average congestion level of 29%[[4]](https://www.tomtom.com/traffic-index/singapore-traffic/#), which is defined as the ratio of how much longer drivers spend on their commute during peak hours compared to non-peak hours. Singaporean commuters on avarage wastes about 105 additional hours per year when driving in rush hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is critical for drivers and commuters to be able to monitor the current traffic conditions, as well as get a prediction on when the conditions are ideal for travel. This will then enable road users to decide on the best time and route for their travel. "

    "#### Static traffic images\n",
    "Road users typically use various traffic monitoring apps and websites in order to plan their travel and attempt to beat the traffic. To assess the current traffic conditions, commuters usually rely on several websites which display a static image of traffic cameras (e.g.: [[5]](https://onemotoring.lta.gov.sg/content/onemotoring/home/driving/traffic_information/traffic-cameras/bke.html#trafficCameras), [[6]](https://www.motorist.sg/traffic-cameras), [[7]](https://www.trafficiti.com/)) which are obtained from the same traffic cameras provided by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) Datamall API [[8]](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/dynamic-data.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "The static images provided by these websites means that users would have to estimate the amount of cars present in the image and guess the curent traffic conditions based on a single static image. Furthermore, these websites typically do not provide historical/previous traffic images, making it difficult for users to assess the current traffic condition in the context of the overall traffic condition. Ultimately, since neither vehicle count nor historical data is provided, users would not be able to obtain a reasonable forecast of traffic conditions using these websites\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../images/notebook_images/other_traffic_images_website.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Crowd-sourced traffic density estimations\n",
    "An alternative for the traffic images websites are the apps and websites which provides crowd-sourced traffic density estimations, such as Google Maps or Apple Maps. Other than being used for navigation purposes, some of these apps are able to display the current traffic conditions based on crowd-sourced informations (i.e.: getting data from fellow app users). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, these type of crowd-sourced information could not achieve the level of accuracy of actual sensors and traffic measurements. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to malicious attacks such as when someone used 99 iPhones to create a cluster of \"traffic jams\" in Berlin's Road [[9]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5eL_al_m7Q).\n",
    "\n",
    "With a recent update, Google maps is now able to display 'typical' traffic conditions based on historical crowd-sourced traffic data. This provides users a very basic estimate/forecast of future traffic conditions based on the average weekly traffic information. However, as we shall discover later in this project, the so-called 'naive seasonal' prediction based on past week's data does not provide the best accuracy compared to other more sophisticated models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the level of detail / granularity of information for the traffic condition provided by Google Maps is highly lacking, by only providing users with a 4-level color-coded information regarding the traffic condition, going from low to high. While this level of granularity should be sufficient for road users who are planning their commute, it might not be sufficient for the purposes of a long-term traffic monitoring / survey for government agencies for the purposes of transportation planning. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../images/notebook_images/other_traffic_images_website_gmaps.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traffic monitoring and survey for government\n",
    "Government agencies typically employ a multitude of sensors and techniques in order to conduct traffic counting for monitoring and survey purposes. These techniques range from manual counting or using radar-based sensors, which are highly labour-intensive or have high equipment cost, respectively. As such, using traffic counts from traffic cameras could be a highly efficient solution with relatively low costs compared to the alternative, especially for preliminary survey prior to employing other more accurate but more costly solutions.\n",

    "The first step for in this traffic analysis project is to scrape the traffic images from LTA. The traffic images are provided by LTA through the [Datamall API](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/dynamic-data.html):\n",
